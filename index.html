        <p> Dream (born August 12, 1999)[1][2] is the pseudonym of an American YouTuber and Twitch streamer who is known primarily for creating Minecraft content.

Dream gained substantial popularity in 2019 and 2020, rising to prominence with his YouTube series Minecraft Manhunt.[4] He is well known for his Minecraft speedruns,[5] in which he was accused of cheating in late 2020 (he later admitted to using game modifications, albeit maintaining that advantages in his speedrun gameplay were unintentional). Content created in the Dream SMP, an invite-only survival multiplayer (SMP) Minecraft server that stars Minecraft content creators engaged in roleplay, has also attracted considerable attention.[6]<br>

            As of January 26, 2022, his seven YouTube channels have collectively reached over 39 million subscribers and over 2.9 billion total views. YouTube awarded Dream the Streamy Award for Gaming in both 2020 and 2021.<br>Dream's most well-known and most-watched series is Minecraft Manhunt. In Minecraft Manhunt, one player—usually Dream—attempts to finish the game as fast as possible without dying, while another player or team of players (the "Hunters") attempts to stop this player from beating the game by killing them. The hunters each possess a compass pointed towards the player's location and are allowed to respawn whenever they die. The hunters win the game if the player dies before beating the Ender Dragon.[15]

On December 26, 2019, Dream uploaded the first video in this series, titled "Beating Minecraft But My Friend Tries to Stop Me".[16] Dream would subsequently repeat this style of video on many occasions, increasing the number of Hunters over time.[15] On February 26, 2022, Dream uploaded the final Minecraft Manhunt. Dream hinted at bringing back the series in the future. Dream also said that him and the hunters will do a real-life Minecraft Manhunt if the final video gets 2 million likes.[17]

Many of the Minecraft Manhunt videos have received tens of millions of views.[18] One of his Manhunt videos was sixth in YouTube's Top Trending Videos of 2020.[19] As of February 2022, one of Dream's Minecraft Manhunt videos has 108 million views.[17]

B. Urian, writing in Tech Times, said that Minecraft Manhunt "requires not only mastery of the terrain but also the ability to think fast on your feet while different choices present themselves with only milliseconds of time for decision making. This is something that Dream is good at, split second decision making."[20] Nicolas Perez, writing in Paste, described Minecraft Manhunt as "an experience that leaves me slack-jawed every time", stating that the format of Minecraft Manhunt "seems to guarantee the hunters come out on top. But more often than not, Dream pulls just enough aces out of his sleeve to narrowly beat the hunters, and eventually the game."[15] Gonzalo Cardona, writing in Ginx TV, noted that Minecraft Manhunt had "inspired cult-like montages by fans".[2] Nathan Grayson, writing in Kotaku, said that Minecraft Manhunt had turned Dream "into a household name among Minecraft fans".[21]  </p>
